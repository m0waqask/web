# React
Below will be the notes Im gonna make on each class.

# Class 1
#### Whats a DOM?
DOM, or Document Object Model, is like the blueprint for your webpage. Think of it like a puppet show:

HTML: The puppets (your content).
CSS: The clothes and style of the puppets.
JavaScript: The puppet master pulling the strings.
DOM: The stage layout, the rules of the show, and how the puppets move and interact with each other.
When you mess with the DOM, you’re telling the puppet master (JavaScript) to change something on stage—like making a puppet dance or changing its costume (the content and layout of your page). Every time you click something or trigger an event, JS is like, "Yo, DOM, we need a quick change!" The DOM makes that change happen on the page without refreshing the whole damn thing.

So, in simple terms: The DOM is the behind-the-scenes system that lets JS update and interact with your webpage in real-time.

#### Why React is better than plain old HTML/CSS/JS:
Component-based: React breaks down the page into little chunks (components) you can reuse, like LEGO blocks, instead of building a whole damn new thing every time.
Efficient updates: Instead of reloading the entire page, React only updates the parts that need to change—no full-page refresh BS.
Cleaner code: React keeps things organized. If your project is big, it’s easier to manage with React, so you don’t end up with a chaotic mess of HTML/JS.
Better performance: React’s virtual DOM (it’s like a faster, fake version of the real DOM) lets it update the page quickly without slowing everything down.
Easy to debug: React shows you exactly what component has an issue, making it easier to fix.
Community support: Tons of developers use React, meaning there are tons of resources, plugins, and libraries to help you get shit done faster.
So yeah, React isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a better way to handle bigger, dynamic websites.
